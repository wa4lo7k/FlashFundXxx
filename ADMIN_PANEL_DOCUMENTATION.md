# FlashFundX Admin Panel Documentation

## Overview

The FlashFundX admin panel provides comprehensive management capabilities for the prop trading platform, including user management, order tracking, account inventory management, and business analytics. The system uses Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure secure admin access.

## Admin Authentication

### Admin Access Requirements
- **Admin Email**: `admin@flashfundx.com`
- **Authentication**: Standard Supabase authentication
- **Permissions**: Full access to all tables and functions via RLS policies

### Admin Login Process
1. Create admin user in Supabase Auth with email `admin@flashfundx.com`
2. Admin user automatically gets full access through RLS policies
3. All admin queries check for this specific email address

```sql
-- Example RLS policy for admin access
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all profiles" ON public.user_profiles
    FOR ALL USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
            WHERE id = auth.uid()
            AND email = 'admin@flashfundx.com'
        )
    );
```

## Core Admin Functions

### 1. User Management

#### View All Users
```sql
-- Get comprehensive user overview
SELECT 
    id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    phone,
    country,
    account_status,
    total_orders,
    total_spent,
    signup_ip,
    last_login_at,
    created_at
FROM user_profiles 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

#### User Search and Filtering
```sql
-- Search users by email, name, or phone
SELECT * FROM user_profiles 
WHERE email ILIKE '%search_term%' 
   OR first_name ILIKE '%search_term%' 
   OR last_name ILIKE '%search_term%'
   OR phone ILIKE '%search_term%';

-- Filter by account status
SELECT * FROM user_profiles 
WHERE account_status = 'suspended';

-- Filter by registration date
SELECT * FROM user_profiles 
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01' 
  AND created_at < '2024-02-01';
```

#### User Account Management
```sql
-- Suspend user account
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET account_status = 'suspended' 
WHERE id = 'user-uuid-here';

-- Reactivate user account
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET account_status = 'active' 
WHERE id = 'user-uuid-here';

-- Ban user account
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET account_status = 'banned' 
WHERE id = 'user-uuid-here';
```

#### User Statistics Dashboard
```sql
-- User registration statistics
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as registration_date,
    COUNT(*) as new_users,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN marketing_consent = true THEN 1 END) as marketing_consents
FROM user_profiles 
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY registration_date DESC;

-- User activity summary
